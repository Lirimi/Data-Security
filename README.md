**Console Application which implements an effective data encryption system includes:**

- It’s own algorithm for encoding data.
- It’s own algorithm for symmetric ciphers or secret key encryption, which depends on a single key to encrypt the
data.
- Implementation of a hybrid technique which combines the speed of Data Encryption Standard (DES) for
encryption of data and Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithms to encrypt DES secret key for proper key
distribution and management.
- Implementation of digital signature and tokens for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.
- It’s own Database for storing user information (useful in RSA encryption) which includes implementation of
Hashing Algorithm for storing passwords.
